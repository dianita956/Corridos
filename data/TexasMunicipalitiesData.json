    "In the country of Karnes, \nLook what has happened; \nThe Major Sheriff died,\nLeaving Rom\u00e1n badly wounded.\n\nIt must have been two in the \n\tafternnon\nWhen people arrived;\nThey said to one another,\n\u201cIt is not known who killed him.\u201d\n\nThey went around asking questions,\nAbout half an hour afterward, \nThey found that the wrongdoer\nHad been Gregorio Cortez.\n\nNow they have outlawed Cortez,\nThroughout the whole state;\nLet him be taken, dead or alive; \nHe has killed several men.\n\nThey said Gregorio Cortez, \nWith his pistol in his hand,\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret that I killed him; \nI regret my brother\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nThen said Gregorio Cortez, \nAnd his soul was all aflame, \n\u201cI don\u2019t regret that I killed him;\nA man must defend himself.\u201d\n\nThe Americans were coming, \nThey were whiter than a dove, \nFrom the fear that they had \nOf Cortez and of his pistol. \n\nThen the Americans said, \nThen they said fearfully,\n\u201cCome, let us follow the trail;\nThe wrongdoer is Cortez.\u201d\n\nThey set the bloodhounds on him, \nSo they could follow his trail, \nBut trying to overtake  Cortez\nWas like following a star.. \n\nHe struck out for Gonzales\nWithout showing any fear,\n\u201cFollow me, cowardly rangers, \nI am Gregorio Cortez.\u201d\n\nFrom Belmont he went to the \n\tranch,  \nThey succeeded in surrounding \n\thim, \nQuite a few more than three hundred, \nBut there he jumped their corral. \n\nWhen he jumped their corral, \nAccording to what we hear,\nThey got into a gunfight,\nAnd he killed them another sheriff, \n\nThen said Gregorio Cortez, \nWith his pistol in his hand, \n\u201cDon\u2019t run, you cowardly rangers, \nFrom just one Mexican.\u201d\n\nGregorio Cortez went out, \nHe went towards Laredo\nThey decided not to follow \nBecause they were afraid of him.\n\nThen said Gregorio Cortez, \n\u201cWhat is the use of your scheming?\nYou cannot catch me,\nEven with those bloodhounds.\u201d\n\nThen the Americans said, \n\u201cIf we catch you with him, what \nShall we do?\nIf we fight him man to man, \nVery few of us will return.\u201d\n\nOver by El Encinal, \nAccording to what we hear, \nThey made him a corral, \nAnd he killed them another sheriff. \n\nThen said Gregorio Cortez, \nShooting out a lot of bullets,\n\u201cI have weathered thunderstorms;\nThis little mist doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\nNow he has met a Mexican;\nHe says to him haughtily,\n\u201cTell me the news;\nI am Gregorio Cortez.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt is said that because of me \nMany people have been killed;\nI will surrender now\nBecause such things are not right.\u201d\n\nCortez says to Jes\u00fas,\n\u201cAt last you are going to see it;\nGo tell the rangers\nTo come and arrest me.\u201d\n\nAll the rangers were coming, \nComing so fast they even flew, \nFor they wanted to get \nThe thousand dollars they were \noffered. \n\nWhen they surrounded the house, \nCortez suddenly appeared before\n\tthem, \n\u201cYou will take me if I\u2019m willing, \nBut not any other way.\u201d\n\nThen the Major Sheriff said, \nAs if he was going to cry, \n\u201cCortez, hand over your weapons;\nWe are not going to kill.\u201d\n\nThen said Gregorio Cortez,\nShouting to them in a loud voice,\n\u201cI won\u2019t surrender my arms\nUntil I am in a cell.\u201d\n\nThen said Gregorio Cortez,\nHe said in his godly voice, \n\u201cI won\u2019t surrender my arms\nUntil I\u2019m inside a jail.\u201d\n\nNow they have taken Cortez,\nNow matters are at an end, \nHis poor family\nAre suffering in their hearts.\n\nNow with this I say farewell, \nIn the shade of a cypress treel;\nThis the end of singing \nOf the ballad of Cortez.": []
